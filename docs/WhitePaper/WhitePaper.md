# Chapter 1 Software Introduction :

## 1.1 Project background

In the era of digital communication, the format of links has become a core factor influencing usability, professionalism, and brand perception. Long URLs—often a jumble of characters—are hard to remember, take up excess space, and reduce readability, making them ill-suited for social media, SMS notifications, email marketing, printed materials, and professional presentations. With the rapid expansion of internet technology and mobile-first communication strategies, link sharing has become an indispensable part of online interaction across educational, marketing, and daily communication scenarios. However, traditional long URLs often create friction in user experience, reducing efficiency and diminishing professional image when shared across multiple platforms.

To address the URL shortening needs of campus organizations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and individual content creators, our project team developed a platform called TinyBridge. This platform leverages software engineering expertise to create an integrated and reliable URL shortening service, facilitating concise, organized, and brand-consistent link sharing across diverse channels. With the rise of digital marketing and the sharing economy, short-link platforms have become essential tools for fostering campus culture and enterprise branding, especially in today's society where efficiency and professionalism are highly emphasized. URL shortening helps reduce communication barriers and resource waste, aligning with contemporary digital transformation awareness.

The TinyBridge platform offers a convenient channel for users to generate custom short links, track click analytics through real-time dashboards, and manage links through batch import/export APIs. Users can register, create branded short links with custom domains and prefixes, and monitor link performance through comprehensive analytics. For added flexibility, the platform supports QR code generation, a visual landing-page editor for personalized destination pages, and role-based access control to ensure a trustworthy environment. Additionally, users can leverage the community features to share best practices and optimization strategies, further encouraging mutual support and a sense of belonging within their organizations.

From a technical perspective, the platform's front end is built using Vue3 and Vite, while the back end is implemented with Spring Boot or Gin, supporting multiple database engines including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. The system employs a distributed architecture with multi-layer caching (in-memory caching with optional Redis) and Bloom filter optimization to reduce unnecessary database lookups and ensure millisecond-level redirect response times. Authentication and authorization use JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and passwords are stored using Argon2 hashing for enhanced security. These technologies together create a secure, scalable, and efficient link management environment.

The project not only involves software engineering but also the practical application of full-stack development and distributed system design. Our goal is to increase the efficiency of link sharing on campus and in enterprises, and motivate more users to adopt professional link management practices. If the platform proves successful at SCNU and other pilot institutions, we plan to extend its reach to other universities and enterprises, contributing to the broader development of digital communication infrastructure and the advancement of professional branding standards.

Jack, a course-project lead at SCNU, frequently shares sign-up forms, slides, and resources across WeChat groups, Douyin profiles, and class forums. Long URLs hurt readability and are often truncated by character limits; QR screenshots break when forwarded; and different platforms display links inconsistently. Without a unified tool, Jack has to create and modify links manually, ask others to repost updates, and answer repeated questions about “which link is the latest,” which slows coordination and reduces trust in the shared resources.
Across the current market, three types of defects stand out. Technically, many mainstream services rely on third-party platforms and show instability under heavy use, while customization for domains, prefixes, and paths is limited. In process, teams face subscription or usage-based pricing that raises ongoing costs; batch operations are inconvenient; and analytics are scattered, making it hard to track performance. In user experience, long links are hard to read and remember, and the lack of brand consistency makes content appear less professional, especially in character-limited or visual-first channels like WeChat and Douyin.
These pain points lead to tangible impacts: link management becomes time-consuming and error-prone, dissemination efficiency drops when posts must be edited repeatedly, and costs grow with every new campaign or high-traffic period. Inconsistent branding and unreliable redirection also reduce user confidence and click-through effectiveness.
This situation creates a clear opportunity for TinyBridge: a lightweight, customizable, and cost-efficient short-link solution that reduces sharing friction while supporting professional branding. By enabling custom domains/prefixes/paths, QR code generation, a visual landing-page editor, API-first batch import/export, and analytics, TinyBridge aims to give campus teams and organizations a stable, scalable way to organize links, maintain brand consistency, and improve the efficiency of cross-platform dissemination.
