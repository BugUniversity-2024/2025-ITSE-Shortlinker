# Chapter 1 Software Introduction :

## 1.1 Project background

To address the URL shortening needs of campus organizations, small and medium-sized enterprises, and individual content creators, our project team developed a platform called TinyBridge. This platform leverages software engineering expertise to create an integrated and reliable short-link management service, facilitating efficient link sharing and brand-consistent communication. With the rise of digital marketing and mobile-first communication strategies, short-link platforms have become essential tools for fostering professional branding and efficient resource sharing, especially in today's society where communication efficiency and brand identity are highly emphasized. URL shortening helps reduce sharing friction and communication barriers, aligning with contemporary digital transformation awareness.

The TinyBridge platform offers a convenient channel for users to generate custom short links, track click analytics through real-time dashboards, and manage links through batch import/export APIs. Users can register, create branded short links with custom domains and prefixes, and monitor performance through comprehensive analytics. For added flexibility, the platform supports QR code generation, a visual landing-page editor for personalized destination pages, and role-based access control to ensure a trustworthy environment. Additionally, users can leverage community features to share best practices and optimization strategies, further encouraging mutual support and knowledge sharing within their organizations.

From a technical perspective, the platform's front end is built using Vue3 and Vite, while the back end is implemented with Spring Boot or Gin, supporting multiple database engines including SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL. The system employs a distributed architecture with multi-layer caching (in-memory caching with optional Redis) and Bloom filter optimization to ensure millisecond-level redirect response times. These technologies together create a secure, scalable, and efficient link management environment.

The project not only involves software engineering but also the practical application of full-stack development and distributed system design. Our goal is to increase the efficiency of link sharing on campus and in enterprises, and motivate more users to adopt professional link management practices. If the platform proves successful at SCNU and other pilot institutions, we plan to extend its reach to other universities and enterprises, contributing to the broader development of digital communication infrastructure and professional branding standards.

## 1.2 Project objective

Establishing a short-link management platform is a worthy project aiming to promote efficient link sharing, reduce communication friction, and enhance brand consistency. Our platform is intended to offer a user-friendly service for users and organizations to easily generate, manage, and analyze short links. The core objective of the project is to build a web application that would be a proper platform for professional URL shortening and link management.

In order to achieve this goal, we categorized the demands of the software into three main functional modules: Link Generation and Management, User Authentication and Permission Management, and Click Statistics and Analysis. In addition, we aim to study and implement short code generation algorithms and data analysis methods for professional link management platforms. These algorithms can go a long way towards improving the user experience and enabling applications to actually meet the actual needs of the users. After completing the software architecture and algorithm design, the most significant step is the final implementation of the platform. Our third goal is to execute the short-link platform software to ensure the maintainability and scalability of the project. Definitely, we always put user's experience at the core, hoping that this project will be a real convenience for all students, staff, and organizations whenever they have a request to share links efficiently and professionally. In the long run, we are looking forward to create an efficient, secure, and convenient short-link management platform, boost resource sharing, reduce communication barriers, and enhance the interaction and connection between users.

## 1.3 Market pain points

Jack, a course-project lead at SCNU, faces challenges when trying to share resources efficiently. He must share sign-up forms, slides, and project materials across WeChat groups, Douyin profiles, and class forums. Long URLs hurt readability and are often truncated by character limits, making it difficult to maintain professional communication. QR code screenshots break when forwarded multiple times, and different platforms display links inconsistently. This process lacks unified management tools, making it time-consuming to update links and respond to questions about "which link is the latest."

TinyBridge was designed to address this gap in professional link management. Current methods often lead to inefficiencyâ€”users can't track link performance, struggle with brand consistency across platforms, and face high costs with commercial solutions. Communication barriers and scattered analytics only add to these challenges, resulting in reduced dissemination efficiency and potential confusion among audiences.

TinyBridge offers a streamlined solution by allowing users to directly generate branded short links, monitor click analytics in real-time, and manage links through batch operations via APIs. Users can customize domains, prefixes, and paths to maintain brand consistency, generate QR codes for offline sharing, and create visual landing pages without coding. This transparent, efficient platform provides professional link management tools and fosters a safer, more organized communication experience for campus teams and enterprises.

## 1.4 Solutions of the project

To address the pain points of existing short-link services, we've designed key features to enhance user experience on TinyBridge. Users can easily generate short links with custom codes, domains, and branded prefixes, eliminating the need to rely on third-party platforms with limited customization. The platform supports batch import/export of links via APIs, enabling efficient management of large-scale link campaigns.

A real-time analytics dashboard enables users to monitor click performance, including geographic location, device type, and traffic sources, addressing the common issue of scattered and insufficient data tracking. Additionally, a visual landing-page editor allows users to create personalized destination pages without coding skills, and QR code generation supports seamless offline-to-online sharing. These features improve operational efficiency and increase transparency, ensuring a more professional and reliable link management process.

Meanwhile, on top of implementing these basic features, we will also focus on advanced algorithms to promote user experience. The short code generation algorithm employs efficient random or custom methods to ensure uniqueness, brevity, and collision resistance while supporting high concurrency. Data analysis methods implement real-time aggregation and visualized statistics, such as daily click summaries and trend analysis, combined with Redis caching to enhance query performance. Security protection algorithms integrate malicious URL detection and IP hash anonymization to prevent XSS and SQL injection attacks.

By implementing these algorithms and features, the TinyBridge platform will be committed to help users manage links efficiently and professionally. The success of the TinyBridge platform will definitely optimize link sharing processes and improve the effectiveness of cross-platform communication. Our product TinyBridge starts from market pain points and is targeted around users' needs to create this platform designed specifically for campus teams, SMEs, and individual content creators.

# Chapter 4: Market Analysis

## 4.1 Background analysis

With the rapid growth of internet technology and digital communication, link sharing has become an indispensable part of online interaction. Whether in education, marketing, or daily communication, users constantly exchange links to resources, forms, and media content. However, long URLs are often complex, difficult to remember, and visually unappealing, which affects efficiency and professionalism when sharing across platforms. The proliferation of mobile devices, which now account for over 60% of global web traffic, has intensified the need for concise URLs that display properly on smaller screens and fit within character-limited social media posts.

In this context, the short-link service market has experienced remarkable expansion, growing from USD 360.4 million in 2024 with projections to reach USD 1,020 million by 2033 at an 11.1% CAGR. This growth is driven by several key external factors: the surge of social media usage (with over 4.9 billion users globally), the digital transformation of marketing strategies across industries, and the increasing adoption of data-driven decision-making that requires trackable, measurable links. Emerging technological trends are reshaping the industry landscape, including AI-powered analytics that enable predictive engagement forecasting, the shift from static to dynamic QR codes (with 69% of marketers now updating QR code destinations at least monthly), and heightened privacy compliance requirements driven by regulations such as GDPR and CCPA.

For university students and campus organizations, short links not only simplify communication but also enhance collaboration in projects, events, and academic resource sharing. Universities like Ohio State University and the University of Notre Dame have established institutional short-link services to assist their communities with creating memorable URLs for marketing materials, social media campaigns, student recruitment, and event promotion. These campus-specific platforms provide branded short links using university domains, ensuring professional presentation while enabling centralized link management and performance tracking. As digital content continues to expand and user expectations for seamless, professional communication rise, the need for lightweight, customizable, and cost-efficient link management solutions like TinyBridge is becoming increasingly essential, particularly in underserved markets such as campus communities and budget-conscious SMEs.

## 4.2 Market situation

Driven by the booming demand for efficient digital communication, the global short-link service market has entered a steady growth phase. Data shows the market was valued at USD 360.4 million in 2024 and is expected to surge to USD 1,020 million by 2033, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.1%. This growth is fueled by diverse needs across personal, enterprise, and institutional sectors, while also exposing clear segmentation gaps, especially in campus scenarios. Regionally, the Asia-Pacific market demonstrates the strongest momentum with a 22.0% CAGR and 36% market share, followed by North America at 18.0% CAGR with 30% share, indicating robust global demand for link management solutions.

The current market is dominated by several key players with distinct positioning. Bitly leads the enterprise segment across all market categories, offering advanced analytics, custom branded domains, team collaboration features, and integrations with marketing platforms like HubSpot, Salesforce, and Zapier. However, Bitly's pricing structure creates accessibility barriers: while a free plan exists with limited features, professional capabilities require paid subscriptions starting at $10/month (Core plan), $29/month (Growth plan with only 500 links and 10 redirects per month), and $199/month (Premium plan unlocking advanced analytics such as device insights and geographical data). TinyURL remains popular for casual personal use due to its "free and no registration" model, but lacks the data tracking capabilities essential for professional marketing and organizational use. Its paid tier starts at $9.99/month when billed annually.

Other significant competitors include Rebrandly (focusing on branded link management), Ow.ly (integrating with social media management tools like Hootsuite but offering limited customization), BL.INK, Short.io, and Replug.io, each targeting specific niches within the market. Regional players like China's Sina Short URL (t.cn) excel in local social platform adaptation, maintaining stable compatibility with WeChat and Weibo, but generally lack advanced team collaboration functions and comprehensive analytics dashboards required by professional users.

Despite the maturity of mainstream products, significant user pain points persist, particularly for university students, campus organizations, and small and medium-sized enterprises. Free tools (TinyURL, Ow.ly) lack basic data trackingâ€”critical for monitoring event sign-up links, academic resource dissemination, or campaign performance measurement. Enterprise-oriented tools (Bitly) impose prohibitive costs for student groups and budget-conscious SMEs; the $29/month Growth plan's restriction to 500 links and 10 redirects per month is particularly limiting for active marketing campaigns or campus events. Advanced analytics requiring the $199/month Premium plan remain completely inaccessible to most campus and small business users. Regional platforms like Sina Short URL lack essential team collaboration functions such as shared link libraries, role-based permission management, and multi-user workflows needed for coordinated project teamwork. Furthermore, none of the major players offer campus-specific features such as academic event calendars, resource classification tags optimized for educational content, or integration with campus management systems. This creates a clear market gap: lightweight, cost-efficient solutions that balance professional analytics capabilities, team collaboration tools, and campus-specific customization at price points accessible to educational institutions and SMEs.

## 4.3 Market analysis and positioning

### 4.3.1 Large market demand

The target user base for TinyBridge primarily consists of campus organizations, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and individual content creators. The potential user scale is substantial: in China alone, there are over 30 million SMEs and thousands of higher education institutions with numerous active student organizations and project teams. These users frequently engage in activities requiring efficient link sharing, such as course project coordination, event promotions, marketing campaigns, and resource distribution.

Campus Project Teams like Jack at SCNU need to share frequently updated resources (sign-up forms, slides) across multiple platforms (WeChat, DingTalk, forums). Manually managing long URLs is time-consuming and error-prone. SME Marketing Personnel require branded, trackable short links for campaigns across social media, emails, and advertisements to analyze effectiveness and maintain brand consistency. Individual Content Creators such as bloggers and social media influencers need to share concise, clean links in bio sections or posts to improve click-through rates and user experience.

The global URL shortener market is experiencing steady growth, driven by increasing digital marketing activities and the proliferation of social media. The demand for cost-effective, customizable, and reliable short-link services is expanding rapidly within these segments. TinyBridge provides a lightweight, customizable, and cost-efficient solution that directly addresses the high costs of commercial platforms and the limited functionality of free alternatives. Its support for custom domains/branded paths, batch operations via API, and integrated analytics empowers users to manage links efficiently while enhancing brand visibility.

### 4.3.2 User group analysis

**a. Campus Project Team Users**

Campus project teams represent a significant user segment with distinct needs and behaviors. These users typically consist of student organization leaders, course project coordinators, university marketing departments, and event planners who need to share resources frequently across multiple channels. Real-world examples from universities like Ohio State University and the University of Notre Dame demonstrate the practical value of institutional short-link services: their web link shortener tools assist students, staff, and faculty in creating simple, memorable URLs for advertising materials (including vanity URLs on billboards and postcards), social media campaigns across platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube, student recruitment initiatives with links to video campus tours and application information, and event promotion that engages the campus community.

The motivation for these users centers on efficiency, professional presentation, and data-driven coordination. They seek tools that enable quick link generation, easy updates when destination information changes (a critical advantage of short links, which remain constant even when the underlying resource location shifts), and performance tracking to understand engagement levels and optimize promotional strategies. A typical scenario involves a student union organizing a campus festival: the coordinator creates branded short links (e.g., go.scnu.edu.cn/springfest) for registration forms, venue maps, sponsor information, and event schedules, distributes them across WeChat groups, class forums, printed posters, and QR codes on campus displays, then monitors click patterns by time and source to gauge interest levels, identify peak registration periods, and adjust marketing efforts accordinglyâ€”all while maintaining the ability to update destination URLs if event details change without needing to redistribute new links.

**b. Enterprise Marketing Users**

Small and medium-sized enterprise marketing personnel constitute another critical user category, particularly significant given that 17% of failed SME companies attribute their failure to lack of comprehensive digital marketing strategy leading to poor marketing performance. These professionals manage brand promotion campaigns, product launches, and customer engagement initiatives across diverse digital channels. Their behavioral characteristics include regular creation of campaign-specific links, systematic use of UTM parameters for traffic source attribution, emphasis on brand consistency across all touchpoints, and data-driven optimization of marketing spend based on measurable link performance metrics.

The driving motivation for enterprise marketing users is ROI optimization, professional branding, and conversion trackingâ€”yet current solutions often fall short. While enterprise platforms like Bitly offer comprehensive analytics, their pricing creates barriers: the $29/month Growth plan restricts users to only 500 links and 10 redirects per month, and advanced analytics (device insights, detailed geographical data) require the $199/month Premium tier, which remains prohibitively expensive for most SMEs. For instance, a startup's marketing manager launching a new product across multiple channels (social media, email campaigns, partner collaborations, paid advertising) might need to create dozens of unique branded short links (e.g., brand.link/spring-sale-fb, brand.link/spring-sale-email) with distinct UTM codes for each traffic source, track click-through rates, geographic distribution, device types, and conversion paths to calculate cost-per-acquisition and optimize marketing spend allocationâ€”capabilities that should be accessible without enterprise-level budgets.

**c. Content Creator Users**

Individual content creators, including bloggers, social media influencers, and educators sharing academic resources, form the third major user group. These users prioritize simplicity, aesthetics, and credibility in their link management. Their behavior patterns involve creating clean, professional links for bio sections, post descriptions, and content sharing that enhance user experience without appearing spammy or unprofessional. With 69% of marketers now updating QR code destinations at least monthly to maintain relevance and adapt to changing content strategies, dynamic link management has become essential rather than optional for this user category.

Content creators are motivated by audience engagement, professional presentation, and understanding the post-click journeyâ€”an area where current tools significantly underperform. Industry data reveals that while 54% of marketers track unique users and 50% monitor total scans, only 31% successfully monitor the post-scan customer journey, and merely 16% can directly tie QR codes or short links to revenue generation. This represents a critical gap that TinyBridge can address. A typical use case involves an education influencer sharing course materials across multiple channels: they create branded short links (e.g., eduinfluencer.link/calculus-notes) for lecture notes, assignment templates, and supplementary resources, generate dynamic QR codes for printed worksheets and textbook supplements (allowing them to update destination URLs if resource locations change without reprinting materials), distribute links across social media (Instagram bio, YouTube descriptions, WeChat articles), track which traffic sources (social platforms, QR code scans, direct shares) drive the most engagement, monitor access patterns by time of day and device type to understand study habits, and analyze which resources resonate most with their audience to optimize future content creationâ€”all while maintaining the flexibility to redirect outdated links to updated versions of course materials without breaking previously distributed URLs.

### 4.3.3 Competitive Analysis of Porter's Five Forces Model

The Porter's Five Forces model suggests that there are five forces in an industry that determine the scale and degree of competition, namely the bargaining power of suppliers, the bargaining power of buyers, the ability of potential competitors to enter, the ability of substitutes, and the current competitiveness of competitors within the industry. These five forces collectively affect the attractiveness of the industry and the competitive strategic decisions of existing enterprises.

> Picture 4-1: Five Forces Model Diagram

**a. The existing competitors in the industry have strong competitiveness**

In the global short-link service market, numerous competitors participate in industry competition, with the competitive landscape spanning regions and operating on an international scale. The market demonstrates robust growth (USD 360.4M in 2024 projected to reach USD 1,020M by 2033 at 11.1% CAGR), attracting both established players and new entrants. Competitors can be segmented into three categories: enterprise-focused commercial platforms (Bitly, Rebrandly, BL.INK, Short.io), free-with-limitations platforms (TinyURL, Ow.ly), and regional specialists (Sina Short URL in China).

Bitly leads the enterprise segment across all market categories, offering comprehensive features including advanced click analytics with device insights and geographical distribution, custom branded domains and vanity URLs, team collaboration with role-based permissions, API access for developers, and integrations with major marketing platforms (HubSpot, Salesforce, Zapier, Hootsuite). However, Bitly's tiered pricing structure creates significant barriers: the free plan offers minimal functionality, the Core plan ($10/month) provides basic features, the Growth plan ($29/month) imposes restrictive limits of only 500 links and 10 redirects per month (inadequate for active campaigns), and the Premium plan ($199/month) gates advanced analytics behind an enterprise-level price point inaccessible to most campus teams and SMEs. This pricing model effectively excludes budget-conscious users from professional-grade link management capabilities.

Free platforms like TinyURL ($9.99/month for paid tier when billed annually) and Ow.ly attract large user bases through zero-cost entry but sacrifice essential business functionality: they lack comprehensive click tracking (critical for measuring campaign ROI), offer no custom domain support (limiting brand consistency), provide minimal or no team collaboration features, and omit advanced analytics entirely. Regional competitors such as China's Sina Short URL (t.cn) have achieved strong market penetration through deep integration with local social platforms like WeChat and Weibo, ensuring stable link sharing and reliable redirection within China's digital ecosystem, but they generally lack multi-user team workflows, advanced analytics dashboards, and international scalability.

**b. New entrants have moderate competitiveness**

The short-link service market shows relatively low barriers to entry from a technical perspective, requiring no particularly large capital investment for basic functionality. New entrants to the industry can be divided into two categories: independent developers creating niche solutions and new business lines developed by large technology companies.

For the former, such as open-source projects and campus-developed platforms like TinyBridge, they pose limited threat to established players but can capture underserved segments through specialized features and cost advantages. For the latter, because these companies have established customer bases and substantial financial and technical resources, if they launch new short-link services, they pose a greater threat to existing platforms. However, the market's current fragmentation and the difficulty of monetizing free users reduce the incentive for major tech companies to enter aggressively.

**c. The substitution ability of substitutes is moderate**

Several alternatives exist that could potentially replace dedicated short-link services. Direct sharing of long URLs remains the most basic substitute, though it suffers from poor readability and character limit constraints on platforms like Twitter and WeChat. Platform-native sharing features, such as WeChat's built-in QR code generation or social media platform share buttons, provide some functionality but lack cross-platform consistency and analytics.

QR code generation tools offer another substitute, particularly for offline-to-online transitions, but they don't address the core need for trackable, branded short links in digital-first scenarios. Link management features within comprehensive marketing platforms (like HubSpot or Mailchimp) provide integrated solutions for enterprise users but come with high costs and complexity unsuitable for casual or campus users. While these substitutes address specific use cases, none fully replicate the combination of simplicity, analytics, customization, and cost-effectiveness that dedicated short-link platforms offer.

**d. Low to moderate bargaining power between suppliers and buyers**

On the supplier side, cloud service providers (AWS, DigitalOcean, Alibaba Cloud) and domain registrars hold some bargaining power, but the commoditized nature of these services and the availability of multiple providers limit their influence. TinyBridge's multi-database support (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL) and flexible deployment options further reduce dependency on specific infrastructure vendors.

On the buyer side, individual users and small organizations have limited bargaining power due to the low switching costs and abundance of free alternatives. However, enterprise clients with high-volume needs can negotiate custom pricing and features. TinyBridge's freemium model with tiered pricing addresses this dynamic by offering free basic services to attract individual users while providing enterprise plans with custom features for organizations willing to pay for advanced capabilities and dedicated support.

**e. TinyBridge's competitive strategy**

To succeed in this competitive landscape, TinyBridge employs several strategic approaches. Against strong commercial competitors like Bitly, we differentiate through cost-effectiveness and campus-specific features, offering professional link management at a fraction of commercial platform costs while incorporating features tailored for educational institutions. Against free platforms like TinyURL, we compete on functionality and analytics, providing the tracking capabilities and customization options that free alternatives lack.

To defend against potential new entrants, we focus on building a loyal user community through excellent user experience and community features, creating switching costs through integrated workflows and data accumulation. Against substitutes, we emphasize the unique value proposition of dedicated short-link management: the combination of simplicity, comprehensive analytics, brand customization, and cross-platform consistency that general-purpose tools cannot match. Finally, we maintain flexibility in infrastructure to leverage competitive supplier markets while building an ecosystem around our open API to increase buyer lock-in and create a "tool + community" platform that enhances long-term user stickiness and platform influence.

# Chapter 5: Practical application and popularization

## 5.1 Practical application

As digital communication continues to evolve, campus organizations and enterprises are accumulating vast amounts of shared content like event announcements, resource links, and promotional materials that often become fragmented across multiple platforms. At the same time, many teams struggle with inefficient link management, inconsistent branding, and lack of performance tracking. The TinyBridge platform provides a comprehensive solution, allowing organizations to consolidate their link management, redistribute communication resources efficiently, and maintain professional branding across all channels, avoiding confusion and helping teams save time and resources.

TinyBridge is more than just a platform for individual link shortening; it promotes efficient digital communication and professional branding within campus and enterprise environments. By enabling links to be tracked, customized, and managed centrally, teams can make better use of digital resources and reduce the need to manually create and update links across different platforms. This aligns with principles of digital transformation and operational efficiency, fostering greater awareness of professional communication practices within student and professional communities.

On many short-link platforms, users often face challenges like limited customization, scattered analytics, and high costs for advanced features. However, TinyBridge is tailored specifically for campus and SME use, where organizations and individuals can participate with flexible pricing options, ensuring an accessible environment through tiered plans and open-source deployment options. With its built-in analytics dashboard, batch operation APIs, and visual landing-page editor, the platform provides a professional and transparent environment for link management, reducing users' concerns about data tracking limitations and brand consistency.

Moreover, the platform's community features offer users a space to discuss and share best practices. Beyond managing links, teams can exchange optimization strategies, share successful campaign case studies, and assist each other in improving link performance and communication effectiveness. This community interaction not only enhances link management experiences but also fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing, adding to the richness of professional development and campus innovation culture.

## 5.2 Application promotion

To ensure successful adoption, the promotion of TinyBridge must be strategically tailored to the campus environment, enterprise needs, and the platform's features, informed by current digital marketing trends and user behavior patterns. Industry data reveals that QR codes are now implemented across multiple channels: email (47%), product packaging (46%), events (43%), print ads (40%), and in-store displays (40%), while their primary use cases have evolved toward time-sensitive promotional offers and coupons (51%), event information (49%), product details (45%), and video demonstrations (37%). This shift from informational to experiential content should guide our promotional approach. A combination of online and offline strategies can maximize visibility and user engagement.

**Online:**

1. **KOL (Campus Opinion Leader) Cooperation**: Partner with influential campus figures such as student union representatives, tech club leaders, popular student bloggers, and university marketing department staff to serve as platform ambassadors. These KOLs can share authentic link management experiences on social media, demonstrate practical use cases through tutorial videos (e.g., creating branded links for recruitment campaigns, generating QR codes for event posters, tracking engagement metrics for student organization activities), and drive initial traffic through peer recommendations. Given that 69% of marketers update QR code destinations monthly, showcasing TinyBridge's dynamic link management capabilitiesâ€”where short links remain constant even as destination URLs changeâ€”will resonate strongly with this audience.

2. **Campus public accounts and microblogs**: Collaborate with campus WeChat official accounts, Weibo accounts, Douyin profiles, and student forums to publish content highlighting professional link management benefits. Focus on themes supported by real data: communication efficiency (important given that 87% of marketers struggle to understand customer journeys after link clicks), brand consistency across platforms (addressing the 18% CAGR growth in branded link adoption), and data-driven decision-making (crucial since only 31% currently track post-click journeys and 16% tie links to revenue). Feature case studies such as how Ohio State University or Notre Dame use institutional short-link services for student recruitment, event promotion, and academic resource distribution. Include step-by-step guides, video tutorials, and live webinars demonstrating batch link creation, UTM parameter setup, and analytics dashboard interpretation to lower adoption barriers.

1. **Propaganda display boards and posters**: Strategically place eye-catching promotional materials in high-traffic areas (dormitories, classrooms, libraries, innovation labs, cafeterias, student activity centers) that introduce TinyBridge's core value propositions: cost savings compared to enterprise platforms, professional analytics without $199/month fees, campus-specific features unavailable in commercial solutions, and seamless integration with Chinese social platforms. Include dynamic QR codes (aligned with the trend away from static codes) that lead to registration pages, tutorial resources, and success story showcases. Design materials should emphasize concrete benefits with quantifiable outcomes (e.g., "Track your event promotion effectivenessâ€”see which platforms drive the most registrations") rather than abstract features, capitalizing on the proven effectiveness of QR codes in print advertising (40% adoption rate) and event promotion (43% adoption rate).

2. **Lectures and club activities**: Organize workshops in partnership with technology clubs, entrepreneurship associations, marketing societies, student unions, and innovation labs, focusing on practical skills that address documented pain points. Workshop themes should include "Overcoming the 87% Challenge: Understanding Your Audience's Post-Click Journey," "From Clicks to Conversions: Tracking ROI Without Enterprise Budgets," and "Dynamic QR Codes for Campus Events: Update Destinations Without Reprinting Posters." During sessions, demonstrate how TinyBridge addresses the market gaps identified in our research: comprehensive analytics at accessible price points, team collaboration features missing from free platforms, and campus-specific customization unavailable elsewhere. Provide hands-on training for creating branded short links (e.g., go.scnu.edu.cn/clubfair2025), generating trackable QR codes for posters and flyers, setting up batch link imports for large campaigns, and interpreting click analytics dashboards to optimize promotional strategies. Offer incentives aligned with user motivations: premium feature trials for student organizations planning events, extended analytics access for SME representatives managing marketing campaigns, and priority support for content creators building their personal brands.

By implementing these integrated, data-informed online and offline promotion strategies that directly address documented user pain points (87% struggle with post-click journey understanding, 69% need flexible link updates, 17% of SME failures linked to poor digital marketing), TinyBridge can effectively reach target users, demonstrate measurable value propositions backed by industry research, and build a growing community of engaged users who benefit from professional link management tools previously accessible only at enterprise price points, while contributing to platform improvement through feedback and feature requests.

# Conclusion

The TinyBridge project was created to meet the growing demand for professional link management among campus organizations, SMEs, and individual content creators, addressing practical needs and promoting digital communication efficiency and brand consistency. Our development team used technologies like Vue3, Vite, Spring Boot, and Gin on the front and back end, creating a user-friendly platform for managing links within campus and enterprise environments.

The platform tackles key issues such as high costs of commercial solutions, limited customization in free alternatives, scattered analytics, and inefficient batch operations by offering features like custom short links, real-time analytics dashboards, batch import/export APIs, QR code generation, and visual landing-page editing. This eliminates the inefficiency of fragmented link management methods, providing a centralized, cost-effective system for users to share content professionally and track performance effectively.

Advanced algorithms enhance the experience, with efficient short code generation ensuring uniqueness and collision resistance, data analysis methods implementing real-time aggregation and visualized statistics, and security protection algorithms integrating malicious URL detection and IP anonymization. TinyBridge also fosters professional communication by encouraging efficient resource sharing, reducing digital clutter, and enabling data-driven decision-making, all while supporting a sustainable approach to digital transformation.

Beyond link management, TinyBridge builds a sense of community, offering a space where users can share optimization strategies, exchange best practices, and foster collaborative learning. The platform's scalable design opens the door for future growth, with potential for adoption by additional institutions and enterprises. In sum, TinyBridge is a comprehensive solution that addresses real-world challenges while promoting efficiency, professionalism, and community engagement in digital communication.
