\subsection{TinyBridge Project Introduction}

\subsubsection{Project Background}

In the context of digital communication, long URLs—characterized by meaningless random strings—pose significant challenges such as poor memorability, excessive space occupation, and low readability. These attributes make them incompatible with scenarios that demand conciseness, including SMS notifications, email marketing, and social media posts with character limits.

TinyBridge addresses this gap by providing a lightweight, cost-effective, and customizable URL shortening solution that integrates ease of use with professional branding capabilities. The platform is specifically designed for campus organizations, small and medium enterprises, and individual content creators.

\subsubsection{Project Objectives}

The development of TinyBridge is divided into three key objectives.

\textbf{Objective 1}: Implement a secure user login system (using JWT for authentication and Argon2 for password hashing), core URL shortening and redirection functionality (based on an 8-character alphanumeric random string generation algorithm with collision detection), and a basic web interface (developed with Vue.js).

\textbf{Objective 2}: Optimize the web interface for better usability, implement basic analytics features (supporting multi-database storage for analytics data), and improve redirection performance via multi-layer caching and Bloom filter integration.

\textbf{Objective 3}: Enhance the web interface with advanced features, including user account management (team collaboration and role-based access control), detailed analytics (multi-dimensional metrics with visualization and data export), and landing page customization.

\subsection{Challenges and Solutions During Development}

Throughout the development of TinyBridge, our team encountered several  challenges spanning technical learning, team coordination, performance optimization, and security compliance.

\textbf{Technology Stack Learning Curve.} Several team members were unfamiliar with Vue 3's Composition API, TypeScript's strict type system, and Prisma ORM's schema design patterns. To address this, we organized internal knowledge-sharing sessions and established thorough code reviews that served dual purposes: maintaining code quality and facilitating peer learning.

\textbf{Team Coordination and Communication.} Coordinating a 10-person team across frontend, backend, and documentation presented organizational challenges. API interface inconsistencies, development progress synchronization issues, and Git merge conflicts were common. We adopted an API-first approach using OpenAPI specifications with mock data for parallel development, instituted daily stand-ups, and established a structured Git branching strategy with mandatory pull request reviews.

\textbf{Performance Optimization.} Initial benchmarks revealed response times exceeding our 100ms target. We implemented multi-layer caching with Redis (reducing database load by 95\%), integrated Bloom Filter for O(1) collision detection, optimized database indexes, and refactored click logging to operate asynchronously. These optimizations improved throughput from approximately 1,000 req/s to 5,800 req/s.

\textbf{Security and Regulatory Compliance.} Privacy regulations required careful IP address handling—we implemented SHA256 hashing with daily-rotated salts for anonymization. Additional measures included Google Safe Browsing API integration for malicious URL detection, rate limiting (5 login attempts/hour, 1,000 API requests/hour), and XSS/injection prevention through CSP headers and parameterized queries.


% ==================== Chapter 2: Software Development Methodology ====================
\newpage
\section{Software Development Methodology}

\subsection{Why Waterfall Model}

For the TinyBridge project, we selected the \textbf{Waterfall Model} as our primary software development methodology. This decision was based on several key factors:

\subsubsection{Clear Requirements}
The project requirements were well-defined from the outset through our comprehensive proposal and white paper. The core functionality (URL shortening, analytics, user management) had clear specifications that were unlikely to change significantly during development.

\subsubsection{Fixed Timeline}
With a strict academic deadline (September to December 2025), the structured phases of the waterfall model helped ensure that all deliverables would be completed on schedule.

\subsubsection{Documentation Requirements}
Academic projects require extensive documentation at each phase. The Waterfall model naturally produces documentation artifacts (requirements specification, design documents, test plans) as part of its process.

\subsubsection{Team Structure}
With 10 team members working on different components (frontend, backend, documentation), the Waterfall model's clear phase boundaries helped coordinate parallel workstreams.

\subsection{Comparison with Agile and Incremental Models}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Waterfall} & \textbf{Agile} & \textbf{Incremental} \\
\hline
Requirements Stability & High (fixed upfront) & Low (evolving) & Medium \\
Documentation & Extensive & Minimal & Moderate \\
Customer Involvement & At milestones & Continuous & Periodic \\
Risk Management & End-loaded & Distributed & Distributed \\
Flexibility & Low & High & Medium \\
Suitable For & Well-defined projects & Uncertain requirements & Large systems \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Comparison of Software Development Methodologies}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Why Not Agile?}

While Agile methodologies offer flexibility, several factors made it unsuitable for TinyBridge. First, Agile requires continuous customer involvement through sprint reviews and feedback sessions—our academic context provided no real external stakeholders beyond course instructors with limited availability. Second, Agile's 2-week sprint cycles would yield only 4-5 iterations within our 10-week timeline, insufficient for meaningful iterative refinement. Third, our requirements were well-defined upfront through the white paper, eliminating the primary advantage of Agile's adaptive planning. Finally, the overhead of sprint planning, retrospectives, and backlog grooming would consume valuable development time in a time-constrained project.

\subsubsection{Why Not Incremental?}

The Incremental model delivers functionality in successive releases, but TinyBridge's architecture made this impractical. Our core features—URL shortening, caching, and analytics—are tightly coupled; the redirect service depends on both the database layer and Redis cache, while analytics requires the click logging infrastructure. Delivering these as separate increments would require significant interface redesign between releases. Additionally, our 10-week timeline allowed for only 2-3 meaningful increments, providing little advantage over a single well-planned release. The Incremental model's strength lies in large systems with independent modules—TinyBridge's compact, integrated design favored completing all components in a coordinated manner.

\subsection{Waterfall Model Phases Applied to TinyBridge}

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (September 16--22, 2025)}

We began by studying our target users: campus organizations, SMEs, and content creators. Through interviews and surveys, we identified two user roles—end users needing link management and analytics, and administrators requiring system monitoring and content moderation capabilities.

Competitive analysis of Bitly, TinyURL, and Short.io revealed a gap in affordable customization for smaller organizations. We defined core features: JWT authentication, Base62 short code generation with Bloom filter collision detection, privacy-compliant analytics, and template-based landing pages. Non-functional targets included sub-100ms redirect latency, 5,000 req/s throughput, and 99.5\% availability. The phase produced a requirements specification and project proposal as the baseline for development.

\subsubsection{Phase 2: System Design (September 23 -- October 10, 2025)}

We adopted a three-tier Controller-Service-Repository architecture for separation of concerns. The Controller handles routing and validation (Zod schemas), Service contains business logic (code generation, analytics), and Repository abstracts database operations (Prisma ORM).

Database design yielded six entities: User, Team, ShortLink, ClickLog, LandingPage, and APIKey. Strategic indexes were planned early—unique index on short\_code for O(1) lookups, composite indexes on (link\_id, clicked\_at) for analytics queries. API design documented 23 RESTful endpoints with schemas, auth requirements, and rate limits. UI/UX prototypes in Figma underwent user testing, leading to a sidebar-based dashboard revision.

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Implementation (October 11 -- November 10, 2025)}

Frontend and backend developed in parallel with daily syncs and shared API contracts. Backend implemented JWT tokens (24h access, 7d refresh) with Argon2id hashing. The short code generator uses Base62 encoding with a Bloom filter (10M capacity, 0.01\% false positive rate) for O(1) collision detection, persisted to Redis.

Frontend leveraged Vue 3 Composition API with Pinia state management. The analytics dashboard integrated ECharts for visualization with virtual scrolling and lazy loading optimizations. Multi-layer Redis caching achieved 97\%+ hit rates with write-through invalidation.

\subsubsection{Phase 4: Testing (November 11--16, 2025)}

Testing followed a ``critical path first'' strategy. Unit tests (Jest) achieved 87\% coverage on backend services, focusing on code generation edge cases and analytics aggregation. Integration tests verified all 23 API endpoints for success and error paths.

Performance testing (JMeter, 1,000 users) initially showed 180ms latency at p95—exceeding our 100ms target. After Redis caching and query optimization, we achieved 45ms at p95 with 5,800 req/s throughput. Stress testing (10,000 users) validated graceful degradation with no data loss.

\subsubsection{Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance (November 17--24, 2025)}

Production infrastructure comprises three Docker-containerized app servers behind Nginx, PostgreSQL with read replica, and Redis cluster. CI/CD through GitHub Actions automates linting, testing, and blue-green deployments.

Monitoring uses Prometheus/Grafana with alerts for latency ($>$200ms), error rates ($>$1\%), and cache hits ($<$90\%). The phase concluded with documentation consolidation and a deployment runbook for operational continuity.

% ==================== Chapter 3: Software Requirements ====================
\newpage
\section{Software Requirements}

\subsection{Functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{Login and Registration}

The platform provides secure user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token) for stateless session management. User passwords are hashed with Argon2 algorithm, protecting against rainbow table and brute-force attacks. Rate limiting restricts failed login attempts to 5 per hour. New users register with email verification, and the system supports password recovery via email reset links.

\subsubsection{Short Link Creation and Management}

Users create short links by submitting original URLs, with options for random generation or custom short codes. The system uses Base62 encoding to generate 6-8 character codes from alphanumeric characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z). A Bloom filter provides O(1) collision detection with $<$0.01\% false positive rate. Links are cached in Redis (24-hour TTL) for sub-100ms redirect latency. Users can edit link properties, set expiration dates, and soft-delete inactive links.

\subsubsection{QR Code Generation}

Users generate QR codes for any short link, enabling offline-to-online transitions. Generation occurs client-side via JavaScript libraries, requiring no backend storage. Customization options include color schemes, dimensions (128x128 to 512x512 pixels), and error correction levels (L/M/Q/H). QR codes are downloadable in PNG format.

\subsubsection{Click Analytics}

The platform tracks comprehensive click metrics: total and unique visitor counts, geographic distribution (country/city via GeoIP), device types (mobile/desktop/tablet), browser and OS distributions, referrer sources, and time-based trends. All IP addresses are SHA256-hashed before storage for GDPR/CCPA compliance. Interactive charts support date range filtering and data export (CSV/JSON).

\subsubsection{Batch Operations via API}

RESTful APIs enable programmatic batch operations: bulk link creation via CSV/JSON upload, batch export of link data with analytics, and API key management with configurable permissions. Rate limiting enforces 1,000 requests per hour per API key. Authentication uses hashed API keys with scope-based access control.

\subsubsection{Landing Page Editing}

Users create custom landing pages through three editing modes: template-based selection from pre-designed layouts, form-based editing for text/images/colors, and Monaco Editor for advanced HTML/CSS customization. Real-time preview displays responsive rendering across desktop and mobile viewports. Pages can be published, unpublished, or reverted to previous versions.

\hline
\textbf{Requirement} & \textbf{Target} \\
\hline
System availability & 99.5\% ($<$ 43.8 hours downtime/year) \\
Fault detection & Within 5 minutes \\
Recovery time objective & 2 hours \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Availability Requirements}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Scalability Requirements}

The system supports horizontal scaling through stateless backend instances behind a load balancer, allowing dynamic capacity adjustment based on traffic demands. Distributed caching via Redis Cluster ensures cache availability across multiple nodes. PostgreSQL read replicas offload analytics queries from the primary database, while the Bloom filter's O(1) collision detection maintains constant-time performance regardless of dataset size.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

The codebase prioritizes long-term maintainability through architectural and tooling choices. The three-tier Controller-Service-Repository architecture enforces separation of concerns, allowing independent modification of routing, business logic, and data access layers. TypeScript provides static typing across both frontend and backend, catching errors at compile time and enabling confident refactoring. Prisma ORM abstracts database interactions with type-safe queries and automatic migration management. Code quality is enforced through ESLint and Prettier with pre-commit hooks, ensuring consistent formatting and catching common issues before merge.

\subsubsection{Usability}

The platform emphasizes intuitive user experience through responsive design that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. Navigation follows established UI patterns with a persistent sidebar and breadcrumb trails. Real-time form validation provides immediate feedback on input errors. One-click copy functionality and keyboard shortcuts accelerate common workflows. Loading states and progress indicators keep users informed during async operations. Contextual tooltips and an integrated help system guide new users without cluttering the interface.

\subsubsection{Compatibility}

Cross-browser compatibility is ensured through testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, with graceful degradation for older browser versions. The responsive frontend adapts to screen sizes from 320px mobile to 4K desktop displays. The RESTful API follows HTTP standards with JSON payloads, enabling integration with any HTTP-capable client. API versioning (via URL prefix) supports backward compatibility as the platform evolves. The system runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows development environments via Docker containerization.

\section{Software Design}

\subsection{Technology Stack Selection}

The technology stack was selected with three guiding principles: full-stack JavaScript for unified language across frontend and backend, TypeScript for end-to-end type safety, and performance-first choices for latency-critical operations. This approach minimizes context switching between languages, enables code sharing (validation schemas, types), and leverages the extensive npm ecosystem for rapid development.

\subsubsection{Frontend Technologies}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|p{6cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Technology} & \textbf{Purpose} & \textbf{Justification} \\
\hline
Vue 3 & UI Framework & Reactive data binding, Composition API, excellent performance \\
Vite & Build Tool & Fast hot module replacement, optimized production builds \\
TailwindCSS & Styling & Utility-first approach, responsive design, small bundle size \\
Pinia & State Management & Official Vue store, TypeScript support, devtools integration \\
Chart.js/ECharts & Data Visualization & Interactive charts for analytics dashboard \\

Prisma & ORM & Type-safe queries, automatic migrations, multi-database support \\
Redis & Caching & In-memory speed, TTL support, pub/sub capabilities \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Backend Technologies}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Why Vue 3 Over React/Angular?}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Vue 3} & \textbf{React} & \textbf{Angular} \\
\hline
Learning Curve & Gentle & Moderate & Steep \\
Bundle Size & \textasciitilde33KB & \textasciitilde40KB & \textasciitilde143KB \\
Performance & Excellent & Excellent & Good \\
TypeScript & Native & Good & Excellent \\
Team Familiarity & High & Medium & Low \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Vue 3 vs React vs Angular Comparison}
\end{table}

Vue 3 was selected for several compelling reasons. First, its gentle learning curve allowed team members with varying frontend experience to become productive within days rather than weeks—the official documentation is exceptionally well-organized with abundant Chinese resources. Second, the Composition API provides superior code organization for complex components, enabling logic reuse through composables without the complexity of React hooks or Angular services. Third, Vue 3's native TypeScript integration delivers type inference throughout templates and components, catching errors at compile time. Finally, Vue's smaller bundle size (33KB vs React's 40KB or Angular's 143KB) directly supports our performance targets.

\subsubsection{Why Node.js Over Python/Java?}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Node.js} & \textbf{Python} & \textbf{Java} \\
\hline
Concurrency Model & Event-driven & Multi-threaded & Multi-threaded \\
JSON Handling & Native & Library & Library \\
Startup Time & Fast & Fast & Slow \\
Ecosystem & Excellent & Good & Excellent \\
Team Expertise & High & Medium & Low \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Node.js vs Python vs Java Comparison}
\end{table}

Node.js was chosen as the backend runtime for its alignment with our full-stack JavaScript strategy. Using the same language across frontend and backend eliminates context switching, allows sharing of validation logic and type definitions, and enables any team member to contribute to either codebase. Node.js's event-driven architecture excels at I/O-intensive workloads like URL redirection—handling thousands of concurrent connections without the thread overhead of Python or Java. Native JSON support eliminates serialization/deserialization overhead when communicating with the frontend. The npm ecosystem provides battle-tested packages for every requirement, from authentication (jsonwebtoken) to caching (ioredis), accelerating development significantly.

\subsection{Three-Tier Architecture (Controller-Service-Repository)}

TinyBridge adopts a frontend-backend separated architecture with Client-Side Rendering (CSR). The Vue 3 Single Page Application runs entirely in the browser, communicating with the backend exclusively through RESTful APIs. This separation enables independent deployment, parallel development, and technology flexibility. The backend follows a three-tier Controller-Service-Repository pattern to organize business logic and data access.

\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Three-Tier Architecture Diagram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Controller Layer}

The Controller layer serves as the entry point for all HTTP requests, handling route definitions and input validation. Each endpoint validates incoming data against Zod schemas before processing, returning standardized error responses for malformed requests. JWT tokens are verified via middleware, extracting user context for downstream layers. Response formatting ensures consistent JSON structure across all endpoints, with appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.

\subsubsection{Service Layer}

The Service layer encapsulates core business logic, isolated from HTTP concerns and database implementation details. Key responsibilities include short code generation using Base62 encoding with cryptographic randomness, collision detection through Bloom filter queries with database fallback, and analytics aggregation across multiple dimensions (time, geography, device). The layer also manages landing page CRUD operations, team collaboration permissions, and API key validation with rate limit enforcement.

\subsubsection{Repository Layer}

The Repository layer abstracts all data persistence operations, providing a clean interface for the Service layer. Prisma ORM handles type-safe CRUD operations with automatic query building and migration management. Redis operations are encapsulated for cache reads/writes with TTL management. The layer implements transaction support for multi-table operations and query optimization through selective field loading and cursor-based pagination.

\subsection{Database Design}

\subsubsection{Database Indexing Strategy}

Database indexing balances read performance against write overhead. TinyBridge exhibits a read-heavy workload—redirects occur thousands of times per second while link creation happens infrequently—making aggressive read optimization the appropriate strategy.

The \textbf{unique index on short\_code} is the most critical index, serving every redirect request. This B-tree index enables O(log n) lookups that execute in under 1ms even with millions of records. The uniqueness constraint also enforces data integrity, preventing duplicate short codes at the database level as a fallback to the Bloom filter.

The \textbf{index on user\_id} optimizes the dashboard query that lists a user's links. Without this index, displaying a user's links would require a full table scan. With the index, the query filters directly to the relevant rows, supporting pagination through cursor-based navigation.

The \textbf{composite index on (link\_id, clicked\_at)} accelerates time-range analytics queries such as "clicks in the last 7 days." The column order matters: link\_id first enables filtering to a specific link, then clicked\_at enables efficient range scans within that subset. This index also supports ORDER BY clicked\_at queries without additional sorting.

The \textbf{composite index on (link\_id, clicked\_at, country)} extends the previous index for geographic analytics. Including country as the third column creates a covering index for country-grouped queries, avoiding heap lookups when only these three columns are needed. This optimization reduces I/O for the geographic distribution dashboard.

QR code generation is performed entirely on the client-side using the qrcode.js library, requiring no backend requests. Users can customize color, size (128/256/512px), and error correction level (L/M/Q/H). The generated QR code encodes the short URL, ensuring it remains valid even if the target URL changes.

Click events are logged asynchronously to avoid blocking redirects. IP addresses are hashed with SHA256 and daily-rotating salt for privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA). Analytics queries use Redis caching (1-hour TTL) to reduce database load. The system renders multiple chart types: line charts for time trends, pie charts for device distribution, and geographic maps.

The batch API supports bulk creation, update, and deletion of short links. API authentication uses API keys with rate limiting (1000 requests/hour for API clients). Each item in the batch is validated individually, and the response includes success/failure status for each operation, enabling partial success handling.

% ==================== Chapter 6: Software Testing ====================
\newpage
\section{Software Testing}

Unit Testing is part of development testing and it is also an effective form of validation testing. It mainly tests individual program units or object classes, testing the functionality of them. We use \textbf{Jest} as the testing framework for both frontend and backend code.

\subsection{Unit Testing}

\subsubsection{Test Case I: LinkService - Generate Short Code}

\textbf{Scenario:} The system needs to generate a unique short code for a new URL using the \texttt{generateShortCode()} method.

\textbf{Expected Output:} The generated code should be 6-8 characters, contain only Base62 characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z), and be unique across the system.

\subsubsection{Test Case II: UserService - Password Hashing}

\textbf{Scenario:} A new user registers with password "SecurePass123". The \texttt{hashPassword()} method is called.

\textbf{Expected Output:} The hash starts with "\$argon2id\$", and \texttt{verifyPassword()} returns true for correct password, false otherwise.

\subsection{Component Testing}

Component Testing mainly focuses on testing component interfaces which are integrated by several individual programs.

\subsubsection{Test Case I: Registration}

\textbf{Scenario 1:} User enters valid registration details and clicks 'Register'.

\textbf{Expected Output 1:} System creates user record, sends verification email, displays success message.

\textbf{Scenario 2:} User attempts to register with an existing email.

\textbf{Expected Output 2:} Error message: "This email is already registered."

\subsubsection{Test Case II: Login}

\textbf{Scenario 1:} User enters valid credentials and clicks 'Login'.

\textbf{Expected Output 1:} Page redirects to dashboard, JWT token stored in localStorage.

\textbf{Scenario 2:} User enters incorrect credentials.

\textbf{Expected Output 2:} Error message displayed. After 5 failures, account locked for 15 minutes.

\subsubsection{Test Case III: Create Short Link}

\textbf{Scenario:} Authenticated user enters valid URL and clicks 'Create Link'.

\textbf{Expected Output:} System generates short code, stores in PostgreSQL, caches in Redis, displays short link with copy/QR options.

\subsection{Interface Testing}

Interface testing assesses the interfaces of interconnected components, ensuring seamless access.

\subsubsection{Define the Interface}

\textbf{(a) External Interface:} GeoIP (geoip-lite), Email (SMTP), CDN (CloudFlare/Aliyun).

\textbf{(b) Internal Interface:} Controller-Service-Repository pattern for modular design.

\subsubsection{Interface Use Case Design}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Endpoint} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Expected} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
POST /api/auth/register & Valid data & 201 Created & PASS \\
POST /api/auth/login & Credentials & 200 + JWT & PASS \\
POST /api/links & URL + JWT & 201 Created & PASS \\
GET /\{code\} & Valid code & 302 Redirect & PASS \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Interface Test Results}
\end{table}

\textbf{Security Tests:} Authorization bypass (401), rate limiting (429), input validation (400).

\subsection{Requirements-Based Testing}

Requirements-Based Testing validates functionality against specified requirements.

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|p{5cm}|l|}
\hline
\textbf{Module} & \textbf{Test Case} & \textbf{Status} \\
\hline
Authentication & Password hashed with Argon2 & PASS \\
Authentication & Duplicate email rejected & PASS \\
Authentication & JWT token generated on login & PASS \\
Link Management & Base62 code 6-8 chars & PASS \\
Link Management & Bloom Filter collision check & PASS \\
Link Management & Expired links return 410 & PASS \\
Analytics & IP hashed for privacy & PASS \\
Analytics & Data cached in Redis & PASS \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Requirements-Based Test Results}
\end{table}

\subsection{Performance Testing}

Performance Testing ensures the system can process its intended load. We use \textbf{Apache JMeter}.

\subsubsection{Performance Indicators}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Indicator} & \textbf{Target} & \textbf{Achieved} \\
\hline
Redirect Latency (p95) & $<$ 100ms & 45ms \\
Cache Hit Rate & $>$ 95\% & 97.2\% \\
Throughput & 5,000 req/s & 5,800 req/s \\
Error Rate & $<$ 0.1\% & 0.02\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Performance Test Results}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Stress Testing}

Mock users simulate behavior: 70\% redirects, 15\% analytics, 10\% link creation, 5\% other.

\textbf{Results:} Under normal load (1,000 users), all metrics exceeded targets. Under peak load (5,000 users), system performed within limits. Under stress (10,000 users), system degraded gracefully without crashes. Bottleneck identified at database connection pool saturation.

\newpage
\section{Conclusion and Future Scope}

\subsection{Conclusion}

In the development of TinyBridge, we used the Waterfall model to develop a URL shortening platform that encompasses various technologies to achieve a robust and user-friendly system. For software design, TypeScript, Vue 3, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and Redis have played significant roles in constructing the back-end and front-end system, as the Controller-Service-Repository architecture is also adopted.

TypeScript has been utilized to enhance type safety and code maintainability across both frontend and backend. With its efficiency and extensive ecosystem, Node.js has been utilized for back-end programming, ensuring smooth data processing and server-side functionalities, while Vue 3 with the Composition API plays a prominent role in creating a reactive and responsive user interface. PostgreSQL provides reliable data persistence with ACID compliance, and Redis enables sub-100ms redirect response times through intelligent caching strategies.

The adoption of the three-tier architecture has brought a structured and modular approach to the development, allowing for the separation of concerns and enabling efficient collaboration among developers. The multi-layer caching strategy (Bloom Filter + Redis) reduced database load by over 95\% and was essential for meeting performance targets. Overall, the integration of these technologies and the utilization of the Waterfall model have contributed to the successful development of TinyBridge, providing a lightweight and efficient platform for users to create, manage, and analyze their short links.

\subsection{Limitation and Future Improvements}

There are still some limitations in our software product, and we will optimize and improve the functions in future development and updates. Below we list the limitations and future improvement plans by module.

\textbf{In Link Management:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The system currently supports single-region deployment only. Multi-region deployment with edge caching can be added in the future to reduce latency for global users.
    \item The custom domain feature requires manual DNS configuration. Automated SSL certificate provisioning (Let's Encrypt integration) can be added in the future.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{In Analytics:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The analytics data visualization is basic with standard charts. Advanced visualizations with drill-down capabilities and custom dashboards can be added in the future.
    \item The system lacks predictive analytics. Machine learning models for click prediction and anomaly detection can be integrated in the future.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{In Landing Page Editor:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The template library is limited. More professionally designed templates will continue to be added in the future.
    \item The editor lacks collaborative editing features. Real-time collaboration (similar to Google Docs) can be implemented in the future.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{In Platform:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The platform is web-only. Native mobile applications (iOS/Android) can be developed in the future for better accessibility.
    \item Our team may adopt AI to provide smart link suggestions and automated campaign optimization in the future.
\end{enumerate}
