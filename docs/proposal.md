TinyBridge - A Lightweight URL Shortening Service designed for Efficiency and Branding

## Problem

In the age of online communication, how we present and deliver information has begun to play a significant role in effectiveness, professionalism and success. As we continue to market, educate and socialize via the digital age, the format in which we share links has gone from a technically irrelevant topic to one of extreme importance when it comes to user perception and communication.

Long URLs — with their often-meaningless alphabet soup of random characters and symbols — are hard to remember, take up excess space, reduce readability and in general just get in the way of the efficient transfer of information. These attributes make them a misfit for channels where clarity and brevity is key. Long URLs have no place in SMS notifications, email marketing or any social media post with a character limit.

By contrast, short links have become an essential tool to overcome these challenges. They offer a concise, structured, and visually appealing alternative that improves usability while strengthening brand image. Easily applied across diverse contexts — from social media and email marketing to printed flyers and professional presentations — short links not only enhance clarity and efficiency but also convey a polished and trustworthy impression. In this sense, they are no longer just a technical convenience but a strategic component of modern digital communication.

However, despite the benefits of short links, mainstream platforms frequently create barriers in cost, flexibility, and usability. The most notable issues include:

1. High costs due to subscription-based or usage-based pricing;
2. Limited options for customization and branding;
3. Inconvenient operation with reliance on third-party platform;
4. Scalability and performance instability under heavy use.

Therefore, there is an urgent need for a lightweight, cost-efficient, and customizable URL shortening solution that combines simplicity of use with professional branding capabilities. Such a system should not only reduce the friction of link sharing but also empower users to build a stronger and more consistent brand identity across digital channels, while ensuring stability, scalability, and full user control.

## Solution

We plan to develop a Web application to provide a lightweight, customizable, and cost-effective short link platform TinyBridge to all customers. In order to solve the above problems,we plan to implement the following basic functions on the application.

1. Cost Control: Offering a free basic version and flexible tiered packages, supporting private deployment to reduce long-term costs.
2. Customization & Branding: Allowing users to bind their own domain names, customize short link prefixes and paths, and display brand information on landing pages. Reading user data and analyzing it.
3. Convenient Operation: Creating an independent platform with APIs, supporting batch importsolution

## Objectives

### Objectives 1: Implement URL shortening and redirection functionality, build a basic web interface, and user login system

The core of the goal of this project is to implement the URL shortening and redirection functionality. In order to achieve this goal, we will need to design and implement a web interface that allows users to input long URLs and receive shortened versions, we devide the work into three core functional requirements.

1. URL Shortening: Users can input a long URL and receive a shortened version. The system should generate a unique short code for each long URL, ensuring that the same long URL always maps to the same short code.

### Objectives 2: Develop a user-friendly web interface for URL shortening and redirection, and implement basic analytics features

### Objectives 3: Enhance the web interface with advanced features, including user account management, and detailed analytics
